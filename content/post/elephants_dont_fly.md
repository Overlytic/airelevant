Just some motivational content that I need to externalise. 

Looking at the blog's logo, the image of Dumbo is supposed to come to mind. Even though you don't generally explain a rather obvious logo, I think it is the easiest way to lead into the lesson I am trying to learn.

To state it simply, learning to do proper data analysis and machine learning is hard. But what I am realising more and more, is that thinking about learning it is even harder. The pattern that generally emerges for me is the following. First you think about learning something, and then start acting on it. You realise how little you actually know, and how deep the rabbit hole really goes and then you give up. The inevitable question that you then begin to ask yourself is: "Why even try?". However I found that not following through seems to be even more tiring that just accepting an admittedly average result.

So I want to share two quotes that I am trying to incorporate into my life at the moment.

The first is from Dale Carnegie's book: "How to Stop Worrying and Start Living". It is on the very first page.

**"Our main business is not to see what lies dimly at a distance, but to do what lies clearly at hand."**  

The second quote I got from a friend this week. Like the above quote it has been often repeated by life coaches everywhere, but it really meant something to me when he said it. 

**"You can't steer a ship that is not moving."**

I am still going to get to the 5 blog posts that were mentioned previously. However before doing this I am first going to do a [tidy tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) blogpost. It is really an awesome initiative!
