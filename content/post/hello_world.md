Welcome to my irrelevant blog! This is the first step on a quest to master the complicated twists and turns of the machine learning world.  As the blog's slogan suggests, the goal is to learn and to keep things fun. To achieve this I will pick the most absurd and light-hearted projects I can think of!

To ensure I remain focused, I will start with short posts about the following topics:

* K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN)
* Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO)
* Boosting and Bagging
* Artificial Neural Networks: The ReLU revolution
* Recurrent Neural Networks: The LSTM revolution

These were just picked at random and hopefully will grow into a much more structured exploration. Watch this space!
