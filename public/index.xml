      <description>As indicated in my previous post, I am going to analyse a tidy tuesday dataset for this blogpost. I will be using the R programming language and the excellent series of packages called the tidyverse.
This weekâ€™s tidy tuesday dataset is about anime, and comes from MyAnimeList.net. I find this especially exciting since I have enjoyed quite a bit of anime in my life - much to the dismay of my girlfriend.</description>

      <description>Just some motivational content that I need to externalise.

To state it simply, learning to do proper data analysis and machine learning is hard. But what I am realising more and more, is that thinking about learning it is even harder.</description>

      <description>Welcome to my irrelevant blog! This is the first step on a quest to master the complicated twists and turns of the machine learning world. As the blog&amp;rsquo;s slogan suggests, the goal is to learn and to keep things fun. To achieve this I will pick the most absurd and light-hearted projects I can think of!
